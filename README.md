# app_ratings_prediction

According to the latest data, there are 5.31 billion unique mobile phone users in the world now a days. With the usage of mobile devices, mobile application users and development is a new and rapidly growing sector. This report consists of a descriptive analysis and an advanced analysis on the average user rating value for the newly developed apps using the dataset extracted from the iTunes Search API at the AppleInc website in July 2017. Here we create a statistical model that predicts the average user rating value for the newly developed apps using statistical learning techniques such as linear regression, Ridge, Lasso, Elasticnet regression, Decision tree and Random Forest. With a bit of further data cleaning and feature engineering techniques, finally the Random Forest model was chosen as the best model with an absolute error percentage of 9.8%.
